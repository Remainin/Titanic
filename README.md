A getting started question in Kaggle

This code is runable in jupyter notebook or ipython notebook. BUT, please run code after you really understand it, because it is my code draft, and during my revision of the code,some code block may not work OR some lines may be wrongly annotated.
All in all, this code is useful as reference to your own code, make sure you fully understand the code before you run it.
